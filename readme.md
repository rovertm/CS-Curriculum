# Overview

This repository is home to the core assets associated with my self-study curriculum. I'm currently studying `computer science & engineering`(`CSE`) with an emphasis on `data structures`, `algorithms`, `mathematics`, `programming`, `data science`, and `software engineering` -- vs role-specific coding bootcamps. 

I prioritize open & archived university coursework although I plug gaps with various other e-learning programs where necessary.

I'm a full-time professional and complete coursework during free time. 

# Manifesto

### Tenets
* Computational problem solving and modeling have profound carryover into non-`CSE` domains
* `CSE` is _currently_ our best preparatory framework for solving rigorous problems in technology, business, economics
* `CSE` _currently_ offers the best analogies to model, build, and analyze complex systems
* Foundational knowledge in `CSE` will be required to build, improve, and advise the next generation of deep technology products and services
* Self-study promotes greater cognitive strain and higher levels of comprehension vs hand-fed "TurboTax" courses
* Self-study develops valuable curriculum-agnostic skills: resourcefulness, organization, autonomy     


### Objectives

* Complete core `CSE` curriculum comparable to that of an undergraduate education [degree from MIT](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-engineering-course-6-3/)
* Develop tools to automate software processes and manage complexity
* Showcase a portfolio of publicly-available programming projects  

### Motivations

I'm studying `CSE` to increase my problem-solving toolkit and intellectual capacity. 

The legacy paradigms of digital networks, financial systems, and computing hardware have driven software development -- I believe we'll witness the reverse in next generation technology.

Transformative technology is hard to build. Simply "speaking the language" won't be enough. As a business professional, I plan to make meaningful contributions to deep tech industry. Applying computational modes of thinking and holding myself to a higher standard of technical rigor will be where I start.

I've curated courses from two primary sources: 1) MIT 2) Open Source Society University

* **MIT**
	* [CSE degree requirements](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-engineering-course-6-3/)
	* [Scott Young's MIT Challenge](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/), tldr: Scott completed MIT's core CSE degree requirements via open courseware in ~12 months
	* [Scott Young's TedTalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piSLobJfZ3c)
* **Open Source Society University**
	* [![Open Source Society University - Computer Science](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-computer--science-blue.svg)](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)
	* OSSU is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors, minus general education (non-CS) requirements






> "Translated French medical records explained that a man without identification had been taken to a Paris mental health unit and diagnosed as schizophrenic. He became catatonic and was sent to a government institution on the outskirts of Toulon. He became a subject in an experimental program that sought to reverse schizophrenia through the application of cybernetic models. A random selection of patients were provided with microcomputers and encouraged, with help from students, to program them. He was cured, the only success in the entire experiment. The record ended there."
