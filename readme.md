# Overview

I'm currently studying `computer science & engineering`(`CSE`). Study topics include `data structures`, `algorithms`, `software engineering` and `data science`.

The purpose of this repo is to provide visibility to my coursework.

I utilize both open archived university coursework and various e-learning programs. 

Resources that have helped to curate coursework:

* **MIT**
	* [CSE degree requirements](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-engineering-course-6-3/)
* **University of Michigan**
	* [UM Coursera Catalog](https://online.umich.edu/coursera-for-students/)
* **Open Source Society University**
	* [![Open Source Society University - Computer Science](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-computer--science-blue.svg)](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)
	* OSSU is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors, minus general education (non-CS) requirements

> "Translated French medical records explained that a man without identification had been taken to a Paris mental health unit and diagnosed as schizophrenic. He became catatonic and was sent to a government institution on the outskirts of Toulon. He became a subject in an experimental program that sought to reverse schizophrenia through the application of cybernetic models. A random selection of patients were provided with microcomputers and encouraged, with help from students, to program them. He was cured, the only success in the entire experiment. The record ended there."
