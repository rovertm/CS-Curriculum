# Overview

This repository is home to the core assets associated with my self-study curriculum. 

I'm currently studying `computer science & engineering`(`CSE`). Study topics include `data structures`, `algorithms`, `software engineering` and `data science`.

I utilize both open archived university coursework and various e-learning programs. 

I'm a full-time professional and complete coursework during free time. 

# Manifesto

### Tenets
* `CSE` offers the most effective framework to model, build, and analyze complex systems
* Computational problem solving has profound carryover into non-`CSE` domains
* Foundational knowledge in `CSE` will be required to build and improve the next generation of deep technology products and services    

### Objectives

* Complete core curriculum comparable to that of an undergraduate `CSE` [degree from MIT](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-engineering-course-6-3/)
* Showcase a portfolio of useful programming projects  

### Motivations

I'm studying `CSE` to increase my problem-solving toolkit and intellectual capacity. 

Historically, legacy paradigms for digital networks, financial systems, and computing hardware have driven software development -- the next generation of breakthrough technology will be software-driven.

Transformative technology is hard to build. Simply "speaking the language" won't be enough. As a business professional, I plan to make meaningful contributions to deep tech industry; applying computational modes of thinking and holding myself to a higher standard of technical rigor.

I've utilized the following resources to help curate coursework:

* **MIT**
	* [CSE degree requirements](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-engineering-course-6-3/)
	* [Scott Young's MIT Challenge](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/), tldr: Scott completed MIT's core CSE degree requirements via open courseware in ~12 months
	* [Scott Young's TedTalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piSLobJfZ3c)
* **University of Michigan**
	* [UM Coursera Catalog](https://online.umich.edu/coursera-for-students/)
* **Open Source Society University**
	* [![Open Source Society University - Computer Science](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-computer--science-blue.svg)](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)
	* OSSU is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors, minus general education (non-CS) requirements

> "Translated French medical records explained that a man without identification had been taken to a Paris mental health unit and diagnosed as schizophrenic. He became catatonic and was sent to a government institution on the outskirts of Toulon. He became a subject in an experimental program that sought to reverse schizophrenia through the application of cybernetic models. A random selection of patients were provided with microcomputers and encouraged, with help from students, to program them. He was cured, the only success in the entire experiment. The record ended there."
